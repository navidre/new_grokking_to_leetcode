# Mapping the new Grokking Coding Interview Patterns course (2022) to LeetCode 

Pull requests and issues are welcome!

[Mapping Website](https://navidre.github.io/new_grokking_to_leetcode/) | [Educative Signup Link](https://educative.io/signup?referralCode=nrezaeis-xVMKDGxYl5P) | [Course Link](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-coding-interview-patterns-python?referralCode=nrezaeis-xVMKDGxYl5P)

It is helpful to have all the progress and code in one place. Some prefer this place to be LeetCode. Grokking the Coding Interview has been a good course in the learning and problem-solving process. There already exist different gists mapping the older Grokking to equivalent Leetcode problems, such as [this gist](https://gist.github.com/tykurtz/3548a31f673588c05c89f9ca42067bc4). Educative introduced a new version of this course in 2022. This repository can be helpful for people who want to have a map from the new 2022 grokking course to Leetcode. This is a community effort, so pull requests and issues are appreciated!
